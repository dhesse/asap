Air-travel Seat Assignment Program - ASAP
=========================================

Program to assign seats on an airplane to passengers.

Quick start guide
=================

To build, issue the following commands

./autogen.sh
./configure
make

The program called main will assign the passengers given in the main
code, in passengers1.asc, and in passengers2.asc to the flight
specified in sample_flight.asc. There is a rudimentary unit test
included, which may be executed via

make check

Passenger
=========

A passenger has the following properties:

- Name (string).
- Seat type preference.
- Is or is not a minor, e.g. eligible for a seat at an emergency
  exit.

Passengers can be created 'by hand' as in main.cc, or in a file,
c.f. passengers1.asc, passengers2.asc. Usually, passengers are grouped
in a PassengerGroup, which in addition to a list of passengers has a
travel category, i.e. first, business, economy.

Flight
======

A flight is specified in a file, containing the flight number and for
each category (first, business, economy) the number of rows, the seat
layout (seat labels, e.g. "A", "B", ... separated by white space rows
separated by commas), the row numbers being emergency exit rows, and
the desired center-of mass, for plane load balancing. See
sample_flight.asc for an exhaustive example.
